  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>
    I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder studying how
    wild animal collectives process information and make decisions.
    My research combines computer vision, network analysis, and field data
    to understand the evolution of collective behaviour.
  </p>

  <h3>Research interests</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Collective behaviour and swarm intelligence</li>
    <li>Information flow in animal groups</li>
    <li>Computer vision for ecological systems</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I am part of the Gil Lab at CU Boulder, focusing on quantitative approaches
    to collective motion in natural systems.
