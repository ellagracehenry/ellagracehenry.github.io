<section class="home-intro">
  <p style="font-size: 0.7em;">
    I am a PhD Candidate and Devaney Fellow in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado at Boulder. 
    I am fascinated by collective animal behaviour and the potential of emergent properties to shape ecological and evolutionary dynamics. 
    I use long-term observation, field experiments and theoretical approaches to understand the role of social organisation in mediating patterns of information flow and decision-making in the wild.
