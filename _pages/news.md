**December 11th 2025 - New TREE paper**

Pleased to annouce the publication of our new TREE paper, '**Pervasive Loose Sociality Drives Demographic Allee Effects**'! 

Demographic Allee Effects are positive relationships between population size and population growth rate. As a result, populations that exhbit them are particularly vulnerable to extinction when they get small. Social species have typically been considered to not be at risk - in many of the species studied, such as pack-forming wolves, the benefits of socialising are typically decoupled from the population size due to species reforming groups to maintain standard sizes when members are lost. However, here we emphasise that the understudied loosely social species - who do not form fixed groups and instead who's aggregations are ephemeral and environmentally mediated - are likely to exhibit coupling between population size and the number of positive social interactions they have and therefore be vulnerable to demographic Allee effects. Cool!

**August 8th 2025 - MPhil work published in Animal Behaviour**

My first, first author paper was published in Animal Behaviour - **'Sandeels use social cues when uncertain**'. 

Through presenting groups of sandeels with food versus olfactory cues, we demonstrated that sandeels appearing to be cueing in to the decisions of others when food was uncertain, but not when it was certain. In the olfactory treatment, with each added number of swimmers, partially emerged sandeels were more likely to emerge than hide - potentially indicative of a quorum response, a common form of collective decision-making seen across many animal systems to increase speed of decision-making without a tradeoff in accuracy. This was not seen in the certain treatment, suggesting sandeels are trading off potential costs to using social information when private information is certain.  Learn more about sandeels here.
